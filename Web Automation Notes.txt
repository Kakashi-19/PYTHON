The Requests module is a third-party module for downloading web pages and files.
requests.get() returns a Response object.
The raise_for_status() Response method will raise an exception if the download failed.
You can save a downloaded file to your hard drive with calls to the iter_content() method.

Web pages are plaintext files formatted as HTML.
HTML can be parsed with the BeautifulSoup module.
BeautifulSoup is imported with the name bs4.
Pass the string with the HTML to the bs4.BeautfiulSoup() function to get a Soup object.
The Soup object has a select() method that can be passed a string of the CSS selector for an HTML tag.
You can get a CSS selector string from the browser's developer tools by right-clicking the element and selecting Copy CSS Path.
The select() method will return a list of matching Element objects.

To import selenium, you need to run: "from selenium import webdriver" (and not "import selenium").
To open the browser, run: browser = webdriver.Firefox()
To send the browser to a URL, run: browser.get(‘https://inventwithpython.com')
The browser.find_elements_by_css_selector() method will return a list of WebElement objects: elems = browser.find_elements_by_css_selector(‘img')
WebElement objects have a "text" variable that contains the element's HTML in a string: elems[0].text
The click() method will click on an element in the browser.
The send_keys() method will type into a specific element in the browser.
The submit() method will simulate clicking on the Submit button for a form.
The browser can also be controlled with these methods: back(), forward(), refresh(), quit().
